**Problem.** Legal investigations require careful handling of sensitive data and reproducibility.

**Approach.** Local-first LLM prompts, video transcription, and data validation; tracked experiments with MLflow; flows orchestrated with Metaflow. Version control using git and dvc.

**Results.** Faster triage and review while keeping data on authorized and trusted machines.
